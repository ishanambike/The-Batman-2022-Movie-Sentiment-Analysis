# The-Batman-2022-Movie-Sentiment-Analysis

## Introduction:
The focus of this project is to capture data and perform NLP on the data to gain insights. For this project, I am doing an analysis of The Batman (2022) movie. This movie was released recently and has been a popular topic of discussion on social media. To perform the analysis, I am going to use recent tweets from the general public and also scrape critic reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes website. By analyzing both I can get the overall reaction to the movie and also see if critics' reactions differ from the general public.

## Data Captured:
To analyze the reaction to The Batman movie, I have collected public reactions from tweets and criticsâ€™ reactions from the Rotten Tomatoes website. 

### Tweets collection:
As Twitter is a platform where people express their emotions and reactions, I have collected tweets regarding the movie to see what general reactions to the movie are. #TheBatman is the most popular hashtag on Twitter used for this movie. So, I have collected the most recent 2000 tweets containing this hashtag and excluded the retweets. Since the movie was released on 4th March 2022, I have collected the most recent tweets after this date. For each tweet, I have collected data like username who posted the tweet, user description, user location, favorite count(likes), user total tweets, number of retweets for the tweet, tweet text, hashtags used, and created time.


### Rotten Tomatoes reviews scraping:
I have scraped data from the page https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_batman/reviews. It contains reviews of 437 critics in brief. If a critic writes a good review for the movie then it is rated as fresh or else rotten for a bad review. The publication in which the detailed review is posted and the date of review is also provided.
